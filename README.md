# TIL
> Today I Learned

A collection of issues, fixes and wonders I have noted during my professional
career. My goal is to help myself and others by writing these publicly. Here's
to google, hopefully they allow these TILs to help someone on their research.

I am professional Automation Engineer working on both industrial and maritime
sectors on Europe. Besides my work on automation systems like ABBs 800xA,
Siemens Simatic and Codesys, I have done some personal projects on PC programming
languages like Python3, Rust and C (for Teensy-platform).

As a side-rant the industrial and maritime automation systems should really
look into general programming workflows, and maybe learn a thing or two.
