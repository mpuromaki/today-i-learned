### [Signal, messaging software for all platforms.](https://signal.org/)

Signal is one of the greatest software created in 2000's. It is open source
messaging software which uses double-ratcheting [signal encryption](https://signal.org/docs/)
for very powerful encryption, allowing both perfect historical- and forward
secrecy.

The software, especially on Android, is very simple to install and use.
You can get if from Google Play Store and then it just takes couple taps
to set everything up. All the encryption stuff is done automatically by
the software itself, so the user does not have to worry about key handling.
The Signal app also can be set up to handle normal SMS messages, so those
get stored into local encrypted store alongside the encrypted Signal
messages.

The encryption used in Signal is very interesting and I highly suggest
reading the white-papers and security audit documentation about it. 

This encryption is also used on Whatsapp after Whatsapp hired Open Whisper
Systems (now non-profit Signal Foundation) to fix their encryption/privacy
issues. But remember that even if Whatsapp seems to be as secure as Signal,
it is still owned by Facebook and the software itself can use side-channels
to feed data back to Facebook. And recent history has shown, multiple times,
that Facebook can not be trusted with handling private data.

Let's not go more into Cambridge Analytica, or Facebooks social feed experiments
which could have caused suicides..
