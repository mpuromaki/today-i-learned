# About automation

Today's automation is more complex than ever before. Systems which were used to replace mechanical relays are now 
used to communicate with PLM or ERP systems while calculating intricate analyses to optimise the production. PC and 
server systems with redundant networking setups for highly-available systems are now commonplace even in industrial 
automation.

Despite the environment changing, the industry has been slow to adapt. Design of automation software architecture 
has not been part of proper development cycle; PC-systems, version control, documentation and digital security are 
an afterthought; code reviews are lacking. These issues create systems where automation engineers need to be on-site 
for years after commissioning, fixing small issues while causing new ones; where the operator's primary job is to run 
to the "alarm silence" button.

This is why I am dedicated to gathering expertise in industrial automation and surrounding fields to provide useful 
advice and solutions.  
Because of my earlier education in metalworking and machining I have understanding of mechanical assemblies & processes, 
hydraulics, pneumatics, drawings and design. My hobbies and general interest in programming allows understanding of 
modern software architecture, version control systems and generally best practices of software development.  
B.Eng. in automation engineering and experience in developing automation systems for factories and maritime industry 
brings all those together into a valuable combination.  

Specifically for automation systems I am advocating for proper software architecture, software development processes 
with version control, high performance HMIs and alarm management for operators sake.

Ethics also needs to be taken into consideration. Archimedean Oath is a great start, but more specifically it needs to 
be understood that automation software always has real world consequences. Thus the software development process needs 
to be handled as such.
