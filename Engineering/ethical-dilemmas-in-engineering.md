# Ethical Dilemmas in Engineering

[Andreessen's Corollary: Ethical Dilemmas in Software Engineering by Bryan Cantrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wtvQZijPzg)

This talk in 2019 by Brian Cantrill has very important takes on ethics in Software Engineering. These are 
things that should be taken into account much more, especially in Automation Engineering where the whole
reason for the software is usually safety of people working with the system. Proper Engineering practices,
tools and processes should not be optional. Automation Engineering should not be the wild west I've seen.

## Archimedean Oath 

Considering the life of Archimedes of Syracuse who illustrated the ambiguous potential of technology since the Antiquity,  
Considering the growing responsibility of engineers and scientists towards societies and nature,  
Considering the importance of the ethical problems stemming from technology and its applications,  
Today, I commit to the following statements and shall endeavor to reach towards the ideal that they represent:  

- I shall practice for the good of humankind, respecting human rights and the environment.
- I shall recognize the responsibility for my actions, after informing myself to the best of my abilities, and shall in no case discharge my responsibilities on another person.
- I shall endeavor to perfect my professional abilities.
- When choosing and implementing projects, I shall remain wary of their context and their consequences, notably in their technical, economic, social and ecological aspects.
- I shall give particular attention to projects with military applications.
- I shall contribute, to the extent of my abilities, to promote equitable relationships between people and to support the development of economically weaker countries.
- I shall transmit, with rigor and honesty, to discerningly chosen interlocutors, any important information, if it constitutes a gain for society or if its retention constitutes a danger for others. In the latter case, I shall ensure that the communication yields concrete action.
- I shall not let myself be governed by the defense of my own interests or those of my corporation.
- I shall endeavor, to the best of my abilities, to lead my company to take into account the preoccupations of the present oath.
- I shall practice my profession in complete intellectual honesty, with conscience and dignity.

I solemnly take this oath, freely and on my honor.
