# Linux and laptop charging

I'm running lenovo laptop with Pop_OS! distribution of Linux. My current setup doesn't support System76 built-in battery charging limits.
But given my usecase is to have the laptop mostly connected to USB-C dock, normally the laptop tries to always charge. This leads to spicy pillows.

This GNOME extension seems to fix the issue and allow me to set "maximum lifespan" charging mode:
